# AdvDataLogging
Experiments in Data Logging

Purpose: Python code to let you experiment with signals and noise to see the effect of various techniques used in data logging.  Originally published on Instructables, this is a minor update to Python 3.6 and a posting here to make the matarial easier to view and download.

Enviroment: Program should run on any OS supporting Python 3.6.  This should include Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.  So far only tested on Windows.

Program Status: Seems to be fine, done.  Could be extended, let me know as I use this code in several other projects of mine.

Guide to Repository

* Root - all code ( src ) required to run the application.  I think it qualifies as pure python ( 3.6 ).   simulate_logging.py contains the "main programs".

* wiki_etc - Other possibly useful files, docs, images..... Not required
